goRBAC
======

goRBAC provides a lightweight role-based access control implementation
in Golang.

For the purposes of this package:

	* an identity has one or more roles.
	* a role requests access to a permission.
	* a permission is given to a role.

Thus, RBAC has the following model:

	* many to many relationship between identities and roles.
	* many to many relationship between roles and permissions.
	* roles can have a parent role.
